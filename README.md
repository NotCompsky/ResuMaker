# Why Use This

This is an alternative to using LaTeX.

LaTeX is better - I made this only because I couldn't run LaTeX on my laptop due to a bug.

# Prerequisites

* Font file(s) of your choice
* Python
* Python package `yaml`

# Usage

    python3 cv.py /path/to/my.yaml /path/to/output.html

Then convert the HTML to a PDF - there are many easy ways of doing this.
